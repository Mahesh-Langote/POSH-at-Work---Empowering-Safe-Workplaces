             <p class="purp2"> The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 came into
                force on 9th December 2013 and it applies to all companies/organizations conducting business in India with
                more than 10 employees.<br><br>
                Sexual harassment results in violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality, her right to life to
                live with dignity and right to practice her profession which includes a safe environment free from sexual
                 harassment.<br><br>
                 The objective of this policy on Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) is to provide protection against
               sexual harassment of women at workplace and for prevention and redressal of complaints of sexual
               harassment and for matters connected with and incidental to it. It is a non-negotiable requirement to
               ensure safety for the increasing number of women who are part of the workforce.
             </p> <br>
             <p class="purp3"> “Our success is based on our people. We treat each other with respect and dignity and expect everyone to
                promote a sense of personal responsibility. We recruit competent and motivated people who respect our
                values, provide equal opportunities for their development and advancement; protect their privacy and do not
                tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination.” - The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles</p>
